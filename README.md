# Design:
To design the website, I used input form elements to get the user input. I also included a search button using the HTML tag button. To make the website visually appealing, I included a nice weather themed background and styled all the information using CSS. The output displayed is shown below. The weather app is designed to display the weather information such as temperature in degree celsius, state of weather conditions such as sunny, fog, rain etc., humidity in percentage and speed of the wind in km/h. I also included humidity and wind-speed icons to make the display visually appealing to the user.
